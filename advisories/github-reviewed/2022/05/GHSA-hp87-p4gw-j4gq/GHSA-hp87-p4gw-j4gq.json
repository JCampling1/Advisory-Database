  "details": "As there seems to be no other way to deal with a totally broken GitHub CVE, I'm afraid I need to give notice via an improvement request in the hope something hooman notices how messed up this GitHub CVE is ... albeit admittedly based on upstream.\n\n- The affected versions data is wrong, as it does not concern the widely used yaml.v2. This now causes an enormous number of false positives. See https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/issues/666#issuecomment-1133337993.\n- yaml.v3 has (not only) incompatible unmarshalling changes that can silently break a lot of applications trying to upgrade from yaml.v2 to yaml.v3. For instance, at least in some situations the keys of unmarshalled maps change from interface{} to string. This and other API changes require lots of downstream changes, albeit yaml.v2 isn't vulnerable to the DoS attack that makes v3 panic'king.\n\nAn issue in the Unmarshal function in Go-Yaml v3 causes the program to crash when attempting to deserialize invalid input.",
