  "summary": "Apiman has insufficient checks for read permissions",
  "details": "Apiman 1.5.7 through 2.2.3.Final has insufficient checks for read permissions within the Apiman Manager REST API. The root cause of the issue is the Apiman project's accidental acceptance of a large contribution that was not fully compatible with the security model of Apiman versions before 3.0.0.Final. Because of this, 3.0.0.Final is not affected by the vulnerability.\n\nA malicious user may be able to subscribe to an API they do not have permission to, thus accessing an API Management protected resource they should not be allowed to access.
