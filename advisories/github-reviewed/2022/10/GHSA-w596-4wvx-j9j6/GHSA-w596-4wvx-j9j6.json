  "summary": "ReDoS in py library when used with subversion ",
  "details": "The py library through 1.11.0 for Python allows remote attackers to conduct a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service) attack via a Subversion repository with crafted info data, because the InfoSvnCommand argument is mishandled.\n\nThe particular codepath in question is the regular expression at `py._path.svnurl.InfoSvnCommand.lspattern` and is only relevant when dealing with subversion (svn) projects. Notablely the codepath is not used in the popular pytest project.\n\nThis report is believed to be spam, and is not considered exploitable in any depending codebases.",
