  "details": "### Impact\r\nSVG sanitizer library before version `0.15.0` did not remove HTML elements wrapped in a CDATA section.\r\nAs a result, SVG content embedded in HTML (fetched as `text/html`) was susceptible to cross-site scripting.\r\nPlain SVG files (fetched as `image/svg+xml`) were not affected.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nThis issue is fixed in `0.15.0` and higher.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nThere is currently no workaround available without upgrading.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [Github](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/issues)\r\n* Email us at [daryll@enshrined.co.uk](mailto:daryll@enshrined.co.uk)\r\n",
