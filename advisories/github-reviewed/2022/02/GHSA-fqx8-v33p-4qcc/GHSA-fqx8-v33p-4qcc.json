  "summary": "XSS in enshrined/svg-sanitize",
  "details": "### Problem\r\nSVG sanitizer library before version `0.15.0` did not remove HTML elements wrapped in a CDATA section. As a result, SVG content embedded in HTML (fetched as `text/html`) was susceptible to cross-site scripting. Plain SVG files (fetched as `image/svg+xml`) were not affected.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nUpgrade package `enshrined/svg-sanitize` to version `0.15.0` or later, fixing the problem described.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nThere is currently no workaround available without upgrading.\r\n\r\n### References\r\nSee [darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer#71](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/issues/71) for additional technical details.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [Github](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer/issues)\r\n* Email us at [daryll@enshrined.co.uk](mailto:daryll@enshrined.co.uk)\r\n",
