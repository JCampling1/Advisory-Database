  "summary": "Unsoundness of AtomicCell<{i,u}64> arithmetics on 32-bit targets that support Atomic{I,U}64",
  "details": "Crossbeam are tools for concurrent programming in Rust.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe affected version of this crate incorrectly assumed that the alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. \n\nHowever, the alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`.\n\nThis can cause the following problems:\n\n- Unaligned memory accesses\n- Data race\n\nCrates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected by this issue.\n\n32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue.\n\nThe following is a complete list of the builtin targets that may be affected. (last update: nightly-2022-02-11)\n\n- armv7-apple-ios (tier 3)\n- armv7s-apple-ios (tier 3)\n- i386-apple-ios (tier 3)\n- i586-unknown-linux-gnu\n- i586-unknown-linux-musl\n- i686-apple-darwin (tier 3)\n- i686-linux-android\n- i686-unknown-freebsd\n- i686-unknown-haiku (tier 3)\n- i686-unknown-linux-gnu\n- i686-unknown-linux-musl\n- i686-unknown-netbsd (tier 3)\n- i686-unknown-openbsd (tier 3)\n- i686-wrs-vxworks (tier 3)\n\n([script to get list](https://gist.github.com/taiki-e/3c7891e8c5f5e0cbcb44d7396aabfe10))\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7.\n\nAffected 0.8.x releases have been yanked.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/781 ",
