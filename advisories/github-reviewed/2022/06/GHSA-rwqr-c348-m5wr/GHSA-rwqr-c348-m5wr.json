  "summary": "Not a real problem: Denial of Service in aiohttp",
  "details": "> aiohttp v3.8.1 was discovered to contain an invalid IPv6 URL which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThis claim seems to be invalid: it links to a missing explanation on what the reporter actually means. As an aiohttp maintainer, I see _zero_ proof of any of this being a problem. Also, nobody contacted us to report a vulnerability.\n\nCurrent recommendation: treat this \"report\" as nonsense.\n\n-- @webknjaz",
