  "summary": "Sulu CMS HTML Injection Vulnerability",
  "details": "### Description\n\nA security vulnerability has been identified in the Sulu Content Management System (CMS), specifically within its autocomplete suggestion feature. This vulnerability allows for HTML injection due to improper sanitization of user input in the tag name field. When exploited, this flaw permits the execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in the context of the user's browser session when autocomplete suggestions are rendered.\n\n### Impact\n\nTechnical Breakdown\nAffected versions of the Sulu CMS include:\n\nVersions 2.0.0 through 2.4.15\nVersions 2.5.0 through 2.5.11\nPatched versions that resolve this vulnerability are:\n\nVersion 2.4.16\nVersion 2.5.12\n\nThe vulnerability is particularly concerning because it affects the administrative interface, where only admin users have the privilege to create tags. Despite the restricted access, the impact of exploiting this vulnerability could lead to significant security issues, such as session hijacking, phishing, or the dissemination of malicious scripts.\n\n### Mitigation Recommendations\nUsers of affected versions should upgrade to the patched versions (2.4.16 or 2.5.12) immediately. As an interim workaround, administrators can implement custom mutation observers in the browser to detect and sanitize potentially malicious input dynamically until the upgrade can be applied.\n\nFor further information or to discuss this advisory, contributors and users are encouraged to open an issue in the [Sulu repository](https://github.com/sulu/sulu/issues) or contact the security team at [security@sulu.io](mailto:security@sulu.io).",
