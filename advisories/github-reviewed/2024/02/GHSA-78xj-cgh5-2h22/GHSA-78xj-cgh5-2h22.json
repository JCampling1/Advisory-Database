  "summary": "NPM IP package incorrectly identifies some private IP addresses as public",
  "details": "The `isPublic()` function of all published versions of the NPM package `ip` doesn't correctly identity certain private IP addresses in uncommon formats such as `0x7F.1` as private. Instead, it reports them as public by returning `true`. This can lead to security issues such as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if `isPublic()` is used to protect sensitive code paths when passed user input.",
