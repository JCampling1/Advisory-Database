  "summary": "Consider CVE-2023-45046, affecting applications",
  "details": "# CVE-2023-45046\n\nApplications using Werkzeug to parse `multipart/form-data` requests are vulnerable to resource exhaustion. A specially crafted form body can bypass the `Request.max_form_memory_size` setting.\n\nThe `Request.max_content_length` setting, as well as resource limits provided by deployment software and platforms, are also available to limit the resources used during a request. This vulnerability does not affect those settings. All three types of limits should be considered and set appropriately when deploying an application.\n\n# Affected Applications `BlackMarlinExec` / Master\n\nFor a relevant ongoing CVE, consider adding CVE-2024-49767, which directly impacts Werkzeug when parsing multipart/form-data requests, leading to potential resource exhaustion. This vulnerability bypasses the Request.max_form_memory_size setting, making it essential to use other safeguards, like Request.max_content_length and deployment-based resource limits, to mitigate risks.\n\nIn addition, consider CVE-2023-45046, affecting applications handling file uploads and form data, which could lead to similar issues with improperly handled memory limits. Integrating these CVEs can highlight the importance of multi-layered resource limits in your project documentation for [BlackMarlinExec](https://github.com/byt3n33dl3/BlackMarlinExec)\n\nThese vulnerabilities highlight the importance of resource limit configurations across various frameworks and parsing libraries. Adding these to your case will provide a strong foundation on the significance of configuring memory and size limits in web applications.",
