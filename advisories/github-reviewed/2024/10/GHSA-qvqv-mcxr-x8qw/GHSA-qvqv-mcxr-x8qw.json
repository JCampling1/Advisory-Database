  "summary": "Slim Select has potential Cross-site Scripting issue",
  "details": "Slim Select 2.0 versions through 2.9.0 are affected by a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability. In select.ts:createOption(), the text variable from the user-provided Options object is assigned to an innerHTML without sanitation. Software that depends on this library to dynamically generate lists using unsanitized user-provided input may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting, resulting in attacker executed JavaScript. Version 2.9.2 contains a fix and is available on package managers but the maintainer has not cut a release on Github.",
