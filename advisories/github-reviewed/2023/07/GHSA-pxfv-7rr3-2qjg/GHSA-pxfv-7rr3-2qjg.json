  "summary": "copyparty vulnerable to path traversal attack",
  "details": "### Summary\nPath traversal vulnerability detected in .cpr subfolder.\nThe Path Traversal attack technique allows an attacker access to files, directories, and commands that  reside outside the web document root directory.\n\n### Details\nUnauthenticated users are able to retrieve any files which are accessible (according to OS-level permissions) from the copyparty process. Usually, this is all files that are readable by the OS account which is used to run copyparty.\n\nThe vulnerability does not make it possible to list the contents of folders, so an attacker needs to know the full absolute path to the file, or the relative path from where copyparty is installed.\n\nSome methods of running copyparty ([prisonparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/bin#prisonpartysh), the [nix package](https://github.com/9001/copyparty#nix-package), and [docker](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/scripts/docker)) had a mitigating effect, mostly reducing the attack scope to only include files inside copyparty volumes.\n\n### PoC\n```bash\ncurl -i -s -k -X  GET 'http://172.19.1.2:3923/.cpr/%2Fetc%2Fpasswd'\n```\n\nAdditional examples:\n\nhttp://172.19.4.2:3923/.cpr/a/..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd\n\nhttp://172.19.4.2:3923/.cpr/deps/..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd\n\n### Checking for exposure\n\nif copyparty is running behind a reverse proxy, you can check the access-logs for traces of attacks, by grepping your access-logs for URLs containing both `.cpr/` and `%2F`\n* nginx:\n  ```bash\n  (gzip -dc access.log*.gz; cat access.log) | sed -r 's/\" [0-9]+ .*//' | grep -E 'cpr/.*%2[^0]' | grep -vF data:image/svg\n  ```\n",
