  "summary": "sweetalert2 v11.6.14 and above contains potentially undesirable behavior",
  "details": "Versions `11.6.14` and above of the sweetalert2 library contain a critical vulnerability that manifests in targeted disruption of user experience. Contrary to the intended functionality of this UI library, the package automatically plays loud political music and blocks user interaction on websites when certain conditions related to top-level domains (TLDs) and language settings are met.\n\nThis behavior is not only inconsistent with the library's documented purpose but also represents a form of client-side Denial of Service (DoS) and unauthorized media playback. The code essentially renders affected websites unusable by disabling DOM root `pointer-events` and forcibly plays audio without user consent. The issue is particularly severe as it discriminatively targets users based on their geographical location and language settings, affecting a large number of domains.",
