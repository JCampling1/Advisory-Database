  "summary": "Downloads Resources over HTTP in selenium-binaries",
  "details": "Affected versions of `selenium-binaries` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `selenium-binaries`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available for this vulnerability.\n\nThe best mitigation currently available is to use an alternate package, such as [selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver), the official selenium bindings for node.js.
