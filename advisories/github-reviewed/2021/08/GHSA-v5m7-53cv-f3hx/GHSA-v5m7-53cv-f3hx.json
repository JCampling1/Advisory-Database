  ],
  "summary": "Undefined Behavior crossbeam-channel",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe affected version of this crate's the `bounded` channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to 0.4.4.\n\n### References\n\nSee https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/533, https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues/539, and https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/pull/425 for more details.\n",
