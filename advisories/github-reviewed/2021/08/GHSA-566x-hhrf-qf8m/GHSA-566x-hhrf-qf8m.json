  "summary": "ordered_float:NotNan may contain NaN after panic in assignment operators",
  "details": "After using an assignment operators such as `NotNan::add_assign`, `NotNan::mul_assign`, etc., it was possible for the resulting `NotNan` value to contain a `NaN`.  This could cause undefined behavior in safe code, because the safe `NotNan::cmp` method contains internal unsafe code that assumes the value is never `NaN`.  (It could also cause undefined behavior in third-party unsafe code that makes the same assumption, as well as logic errors in safe code.)",
