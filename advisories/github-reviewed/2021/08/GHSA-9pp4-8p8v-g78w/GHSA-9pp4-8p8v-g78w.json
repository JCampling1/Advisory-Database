  "details": "An issue was discovered in the lever crate before 0.1.1 for Rust. AtomicBox<T> implements the Send and Sync traits for all types T. This allows non-Send types such as Rc and non-Sync types such as Cell to be used across thread boundaries which can trigger undefined behavior and memory corruption.",
