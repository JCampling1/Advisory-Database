  "summary": "Incorrect check on buffer length in rand_core",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in the rand_core crate before 0.6.2 for Rust. Because read_u32_into and read_u64_into mishandle certain buffer-length checks, a random number generator may be seeded with too little data.\n\nThe vulnerability was introduced in v0.6.0. The advisory doesn't apply to earlier minor version numbers.",
