  "summary": "Server-Side Request Forgery in html-pdf-chrome",
  "details": "All versions of `html-pdf-chrome` are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The package executes HTTP requests if the parsed HTML contains external references to resources, such as `<iframe src=\"http://localhost\" height=\"800px\" width=\"800px\"></iframe>`. This allows attackers to access resources through HTTP that are accessible to the server, including private resources in the hosting environment.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
