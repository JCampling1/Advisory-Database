  "details": "Versions of `next` prior to 5.1.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The `/path:` route fails to properly sanitize input and passes it to a `require()` call. This allows attackers to execute JavaScript code on the server.\n\n_Note that prior version 0.9.9 package `next` npm package hosted a different utility (0.4.1 being the latest version of that codebase), and this advisory does not apply to those versions._\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 5.1.0.",
