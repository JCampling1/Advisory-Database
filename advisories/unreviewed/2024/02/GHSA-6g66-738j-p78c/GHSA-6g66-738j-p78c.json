  "summary": "ClearML Versions up to 1.14.2 Vulnerable to Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')",
  "details": "The ClearML Server's fileserver component, due to improper access control, is vulnerable to Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'), allowing attackers unauthenticated access to upload, delete, modify, or download files, even those owned by other users. This vulnerability stems from the `fileserver`'s lack of request authentication for its endpoints. An attacker only needs the ClearML server's address to exploit this vulnerability. Once identified, they can manipulate files on the fileserver, typically located on port 8081.",
