  "summary": "Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Slim Select 2.0 through 2.9.0 via unsanitized user input in createOption(), allowing attacker-executed JavaScript",
  "details": "Slim Select 2.0 versions through 2.9.0 are affected by a potential cross-site scripting vulnerability. In select.ts:createOption(), the text variable from the user-provided Options object is assigned to an innerHTML without sanitation. Software that depends on this library to dynamically generate lists using unsanitized user-provided input may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting, resulting in attacker executed JavaScript. At this time, no patch is available.",
