  "details": "The Elliptic package 6.5.5 for Node.js for EDDSA implementation does not perform the required check if the signature proof s is within the bounds of the order n of the base point of the elliptic curve, leading to signature malleability.\nThis vulnerability could have a security-relevant impact if an application relies on the uniqueness of a signature.",
