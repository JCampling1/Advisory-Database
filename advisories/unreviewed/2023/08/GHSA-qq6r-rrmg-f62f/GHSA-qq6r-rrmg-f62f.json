  "details": "***INVALID REPORT*** \n\nThe original CVE report stated \"DVWA v1.0 was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the id parameter at blind\\source\\high.php.\"  While the fact is that a SQL injection flaw does appear in this location (as well as many other places within the application), the application is a training application designed to be vulnerable.  One note would be that DVWA actually stands for Damn Vulnerable Web Application.  Another note is that the \"blind\" in the URL is due to this being part of the training target around blind sql injection and to get to this page the student actually clicks a link in the SQL injection menu section.\n\nAs such, this CVE should be removed.",
