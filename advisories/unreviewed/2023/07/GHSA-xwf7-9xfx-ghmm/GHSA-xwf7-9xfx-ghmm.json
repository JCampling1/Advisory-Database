  "details": "Zoom clients prior to 5.13.5 contain an improper trust boundary implementation vulnerability. If a victim saves a local recording to an SMB location and later opens it using a link from Zoomâ€™s web portal, an attacker positioned on an adjacent network to the victim client could set up a malicious SMB server to respond to client requests, causing the client to execute attacker controlled executables. This could result in an attacker gaining access to a user's device and data, and remote code execution.",
