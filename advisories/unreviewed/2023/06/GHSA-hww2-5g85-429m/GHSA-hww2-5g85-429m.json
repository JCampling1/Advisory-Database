  "summary": "ReDoS vulnerability in URI gem",
  "details": "A ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component before 0.12.2 for Ruby. The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific characters. There is an increase in execution time for parsing strings to URI objects with rfc2396_parser.rb and rfc3986_parser.rb. NOTE: this issue exists becuse of an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-28755. Version 0.10.3 is also a fixed version.\n\n**Recommended action**\n\nWe recommend to update the uri gem to 0.12.2. In order to ensure compatibility with \nbundled version in older Ruby series, you may update as follows instead:\n\n  * For Ruby 3.0: Update to uri 0.10.3\n  * For Ruby 3.1 and 3.2: Update to uri 0.12.2. You can use gem update uri to update it. If you are using bundler, \n     please add gem \"uri\", \">= 0.12.2\" (or other version mentioned above) to your Gemfile.\n\n",
