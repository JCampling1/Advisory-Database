  "details": "If a process running within Aruba Instant crashes, it may leave behind a \"core dump\", which contains the memory contents of the process at the time it crashed.

Core dumps could contain sensitive information such as keys and passwords. Workaround: Block access to the Aruba Instant web interface from all untrusted users. Resolution: Fixed in Aruba Instant 4.2.4.12, 6.5.4.11, 8.3.0.6, and 8.4.0.0",
