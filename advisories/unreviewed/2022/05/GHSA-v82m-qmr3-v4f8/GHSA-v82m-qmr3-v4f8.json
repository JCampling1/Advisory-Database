  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges on an affected device. An attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker with elevated privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the administrative web management interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary, system-level commands with root privileges on an affected device.",
