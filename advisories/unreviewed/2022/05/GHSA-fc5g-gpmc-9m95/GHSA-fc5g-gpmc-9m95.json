  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application on an affected device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)-encoded variables in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the SNMP daemon on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
