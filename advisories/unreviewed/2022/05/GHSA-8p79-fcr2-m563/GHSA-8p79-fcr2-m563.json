  "details": "** DISPUTED **  The source code tar archive of the Linux kernel 2.6.16, 2.6.17.11, and possibly other versions specifies weak permissions (0666 and 0777) for certain files and directories, which might allow local users to insert Trojan horse source code that would be used during the next kernel compilation.  NOTE: another researcher disputes the vulnerability, stating that he finds \"Not a single world-writable file or directory.\" CVE analysis as of 20060908 indicates that permissions will only be weak under certain unusual or insecure scenarios.",
