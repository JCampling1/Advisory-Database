  "summary": "Missing permission check in Jenkins Project Inheritance Plugin",
  "details": "Jenkins limits access to job configuration XML data (`config.xml`) to users with Job/ExtendedRead permission, typically implied by Job/Configure permission. Project Inheritance Plugin has several job inspection features, including the API URL `/job/…​/getConfigAsXML` for its Inheritance Project job type that does something similar.\n\nProject Inheritance Plugin 19.08.02 and earlier does not check permissions for this new endpoint, granting access to job configuration XML data to every user with Job/Read permission.\n\nAdditionally, the encrypted values of secrets stored in the job configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the `config.xml` API for users without Job/Configure permission.\n\n",
