  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (Web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands on the underlying Linux shell of an affected device with root privileges. The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input parameter on a form in the Web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges, which may lead to complete system compromise.",
