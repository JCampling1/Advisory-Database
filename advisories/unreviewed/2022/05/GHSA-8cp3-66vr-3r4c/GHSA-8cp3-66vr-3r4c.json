  "details": "\"Anyone\" thinks:\nAn arbitrary file upload vulnerability in formidable v3.1.4 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted filename.\n\nWhat it is:\nYou could upload files with all supported filename by the filesystem of the system.\n\"Arbitraty code\" executed is when using the crafted filenames in own code without checks like in any other XSS.\nAnd \"anyone\" doesn't understand that you can't trust filenames to be safe text which need not to be checked for safety and __blame _formidable___ for it. __formidable__ is simply a tool for uploading files like SCP or FTP programs. And would you blame those programs for making it possible to upload files with filenames which may be unsafe under some circumstances for 3rd parties?!\nWho is responsible for this CVE?",
