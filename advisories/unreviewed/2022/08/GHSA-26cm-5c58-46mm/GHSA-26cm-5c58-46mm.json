As the binary file /home/www/cgi-bin/login.cgi does not check if the user is authenticated, a malicious actor can craft a specific request on the login.cgi endpoint that contains a base32 encoded XSS payload that will be accepted and stored. A successful attack will results in the injection of malicious scripts into the user settings page.",
