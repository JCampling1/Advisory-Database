  "summary": "Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames in OpenEMR prior to 7.0.0.1",
  "details": "Clickjacking is a portmanteau of two words ‘click’ and ‘hijacking’. It refers to hijacking user’s click for malicious intent. In it, an attacker embeds the vulnerable site in an transparent iframe in attacker’s own website and overlays it with objects such as button using CSS skills. This tricks users to perform unintended actions on vulnerable website, thinking they are doing those on attacker’s website. Clickjacking, also known as a \"UI redress attack\".\n\nUsers are tricked into performing all sorts of unintended actions are such as typing in the password, clicking on ‘Delete my account’ button, liking a post, deleting a post, commenting on a blog. In other words all the actions that a normal user can do on a legitimate website can be done using clickjacking.\n\nReflected in GitHub repository openemr/openemr prior to 7.0.0.1.",
