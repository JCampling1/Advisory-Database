  "summary": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in OpenEMR prior to 7.0.0.1",
  "details": "Client-side scripts are used extensively by modern web applications. They perform from simple functions (such as the formatting of text) up to full manipulation of client-side data and Operating System interaction.\n\nUnlike traditional Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where the client is able to inject scripts into a request and have the server return the script to the client, DOM XSS does not require that a request be sent to the server and may be abused entirely within the loaded page.\n\nThis occurs when elements of the DOM (known as the sources) are able to be manipulated to contain untrusted data, which the client-side scripts (known as the sinks) use or execute an unsafe way.\n\nScanner has discovered that by inserting an HTML element into the page's DOM inputs (sources), it was possible to then have the HTML element rendered as part of the page by the sink.\n\nReflected in GitHub repository openemr/openemr prior to 7.0.0.1.",
